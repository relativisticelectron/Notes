This post are my thoughts on the very important article: https://juraj.bednar.io/en/blog-en/2020/11/12/how-could-regulators-successfully-introduce-bitcoin-censorship-and-other-dystopias/

There are 2 properties the goverment hates about bitcoin:
1) Its supply cannot be tampered with (this is enforced by all full nodes)
2) The transactions cannot be censored (enforced by miners only)

While I see no way how governments (even all of them) could weaken 1), the article  https://juraj.bednar.io/en/blog-en/2020/11/12/how-could-regulators-successfully-introduce-bitcoin-censorship-and-other-dystopias/ describes how weak bitcoin is in 2).

This leads me to the following scenario (after full censorship on the miners has been introduced):
* Bitcoin tx fees of forbidden transactions will accumulate
* A some point cypherpunkt/criminals/people resisting censorship will hard-fork bitcoin into "bitcoin uncensored" such that they can mine the forbidden transactions and the blocks are not reorged out.
  * It must be hard-fork to introduce replay protection
  * This created fork "bitcoin uncensored" will have a different price and there will be black-market exchanges trading bitcoin for "bitcoin uncensored". It will be easy to get "bitcoin uncensored" but difficult to get bitcoin (because this will be classified as "laundering money").
  * This will sort-of reintroduce the system we have right now: Anonymous cash (aka "bitcoin uncensored") can be used in samll amounts by normal people or in large amounts by professional criminals. Fiat bank accounts (aka censerored bitcoin) can be used by normal people in large amounts and by mega-criminals (aka banks, corrupt politicians and their friends).
